# Lab 08: Test and Debug the API

**Maps to:** A5, A6, A7

**Objective:** Build a pytest regression suite, reproduce a seeded defect and verify the fix.

**Build:** tests/test_commerce.py with success and failure coverage

**Tools:** pytest, FastAPI TestClient, VS Code debugger, OpenAI Python SDK

## Lab asset inventory

- `ai_vibe.py` - OpenAI Python SDK runner with Pydantic structured output and safe generated-file paths
- `mock-data.json` - authorised synthetic scenario, route contract and test cases
- `mock-database.sqlite` - inspectable SQLite database seeded only with synthetic commerce and CRM records
- `Prompts.pdf` - learner-facing first-run, refinement and review prompts
- `Prompts.md` - copyable source used by the SDK runner
- `working-files/` - complete FastAPI, SQLite, HTML/CSS/JavaScript project, including VS Code REST Client requests

## AI vibe-coding control loop

`Prompts.pdf → ai_vibe.py → Responses API → CodeBundle → working-files/generated/ → pytest + human review`

### Step 10 — Reproduce with the smallest single request.

1. Perform the action exactly as stated: **Reproduce with the smallest single request.**
2. Observe the resulting file, HTTP response, log or browser state.
3. If the expected state is absent, compare the request contract, status code and latest log entry.
4. Save one evidence item before continuing.

### Step 11 — Fix the root cause without changing unrelated behaviour.

## Acceptance criteria

- The seeded test fails before the fix; the full suite passes after it; the regression assertion remains.
- Evidence names the lab number and the mapped codes: A5, A6, A7.
- The saved SDK evidence records the prompt, model, assumptions, generated file list and verification result.
- `mock-database.sqlite` contains synthetic seed data only; no `.env`, live credential, virtual environment or runtime `northstar.db` is submitted.
