# Lab 12: Document and Bundle the Capstone

**Maps to:** A4, A6, A8

**Objective:** Produce a clean, testable release bundle with API docs, frontend assets and operational instructions.

**Build:** release-ready Northstar Commerce API

**Tools:** OpenAPI, pytest, Git, Uvicorn, OpenAI Python SDK

## Lab asset inventory

- `ai_vibe.py` - OpenAI Python SDK runner with Pydantic structured output and safe generated-file paths
- `mock-data.json` - authorised synthetic scenario, route contract and test cases
- `mock-database.sqlite` - inspectable SQLite database seeded only with synthetic commerce and CRM records
- `Prompts.pdf` - learner-facing first-run, refinement and review prompts
- `Prompts.md` - copyable source used by the SDK runner
- `working-files/` - complete FastAPI, SQLite, HTML/CSS/JavaScript project, including VS Code REST Client requests

## AI vibe-coding control loop

`Prompts.pdf → ai_vibe.py → Responses API → CodeBundle → working-files/generated/ → pytest + human review`
