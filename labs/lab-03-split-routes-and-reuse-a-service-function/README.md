# Lab 03: Split Routes and Reuse a Service Function

**Maps to:** A3, A8

**Objective:** Refactor a monolithic FastAPI file into router and service modules without changing the contract.

**Build:** main.py, routes.py and service.py

**Tools:** FastAPI APIRouter, pytest, OpenAI Python SDK

## Lab asset inventory

- `ai_vibe.py` - OpenAI Python SDK runner with Pydantic structured output and safe generated-file paths
- `mock-data.json` - authorised synthetic scenario, route contract and test cases
- `mock-database.sqlite` - inspectable SQLite database seeded only with synthetic commerce and CRM records
- `Prompts.pdf` - learner-facing first-run, refinement and review prompts
- `Prompts.md` - copyable source used by the SDK runner
- `working-files/` - complete FastAPI, SQLite, HTML/CSS/JavaScript project, including VS Code REST Client requests

## AI vibe-coding control loop

`Prompts.pdf → ai_vibe.py → Responses API → CodeBundle → working-files/generated/ → pytest + human review`

## Acceptance criteria

- All baseline tests still pass and OpenAPI exposes each route exactly once.
- Evidence names the lab number and the mapped codes: A3, A8.
- The saved SDK evidence records the prompt, model, assumptions, generated file list and verification result.
- `mock-database.sqlite` contains synthetic seed data only; no `.env`, live credential, virtual environment or runtime `northstar.db` is submitted.
