# Lab 01: Prompt a REST API Contract

**Maps to:** A1, A2

**Objective:** Convert Northstar Commerce requirements into a versioned OpenAPI-first route and data contract.

**Build:** api-contract.md and openapi-draft.yaml

**Tools:** Browser, VS Code, YAML extension, AI coding assistant, OpenAI Python SDK

## Lab asset inventory

- `ai_vibe.py` - OpenAI Python SDK runner with Pydantic structured output and safe generated-file paths
- `mock-data.json` - authorised synthetic scenario, route contract and test cases
- `mock-database.sqlite` - inspectable SQLite database seeded only with synthetic commerce and CRM records
- `Prompts.pdf` - learner-facing first-run, refinement and review prompts
- `Prompts.md` - copyable source used by the SDK runner
- `working-files/` - complete FastAPI, SQLite, HTML/CSS/JavaScript project, including VS Code REST Client requests

## AI vibe-coding control loop

`Prompts.pdf → ai_vibe.py → Responses API → CodeBundle → working-files/generated/ → pytest + human review`

## Acceptance criteria

- The contract covers products, customers and orders, names 200/201/204/401/404/409/422 outcomes and validates as OpenAPI 3.1.
- Evidence names the lab number and the mapped codes: A1, A2.
- The saved SDK evidence records the prompt, model, assumptions, generated file list and verification result.
- `mock-database.sqlite` contains synthetic seed data only; no `.env`, live credential, virtual environment or runtime `northstar.db` is submitted.
